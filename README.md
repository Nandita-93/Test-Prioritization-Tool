An Automated coverage collection tool that can capture the statement coverage for the program under test and then use the information to prioritize the test classes in the test suite.

The tool uses ASM byte-code manipulation framework to manipulate the bytecode. Bytecode manipulation is performed on the fly by a Java Agent which makes use of the Intrumentation API. A JUnit listener is used to to capture the start and end events for each JUnit test method. The agent jar file and the JUnit listener class can be integrated with any maven project to perform code coverage. This is done by updating the pom.xml file present in the maven project rool directory.

In order to use the tool with your maven project, please follow the below steps.

A) Following needs to be added to the 'pom.xml' file.

Add the below code snippet to include the 'JPAgent.jar' file and the 'Listener.java' file as plugins.
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
<configuration>
<argLine>-javaagent:JPAgent.jar</argLine>
<properties>
<property>
<name>listener</name>
<value>org.apache.commons.dbutils.Listener</value>
</property>
</properties>
</configuration>
</plugin>

Add the 'JPAgent.jar' file as a dependency as it is used by the 'Listener.java' file.
<dependency>
<artifactId>TestCompetition.JavaAgent</artifactId>
<groupId>JPAgent</groupId>
<version>1.0</version>
<scope>system</scope>
<systemPath>${basedir}/JPAgent.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>

Add the asm package as a dependency as it is used by multiple files.
<dependency>
<groupId>org.ow2.asm</groupId>
<artifactId>asm</artifactId>
<version>5.0.3</version>
</dependency>

Add the junit package as a dependency.
<dependency>
<groupId>junit</groupId>
<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
<version>4.11</version>
<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

B) Place the 'JPAgent.jar' file in the root folder of the project under test.

C) Place the 'Listener.java' file under the test folder. ('commons-dbutils-trunk\src\test\java\org\apache\commons\dbutils')

D) Execute 'mvn test' command from the commandline. After successful execution, you can see four new files generated into the root folder of the test project. 'total_prior.txt', 'additional_prior.txt', 'A_TestSuite.java', 'T_TestSuite.java'

E) Place the 'A_TestSuite.java', 'T_TestSuite.java' files in the test folder (same location as Listener.java)

D) Execute 'mvn test -Dtest=T_TestSuite' from the commandline to execute tests based on total prioritization.

Execute 'mvn test -Dtest=A_TestSuite' from the commandline to execute tests based on additional prioritization.

##############################PLEASE NOTE:-####################################

The 'JPAgent.jar' and the 'Listener.java' files that are attached here have been configured for the 'commons-dbutils' project. (https://github.com/apache/commons-dbutils)

For other projects,

->You would need to modfiy a line (line 17) in the 'MyClassFileTransformer.java' file and re-create the jar file. The jar file contains MethodPrinter.class, ClassPrinter.class, MyClassFileTransformer.class, StatementCoverageData.class', 'GenerateTestSuiteForJUnit4.class', 'Agent.class' and Manifest.txt files in it.

->You would also need to add the packagename and licenseheader to the 'Listener.java' file. (same packagename and licenseheader as other java files in the test folder of the project)
